            <p>
              I‚Äôm Tommy, a digital product designer. I love to question
              assumptions, hone into clear user-centric problems, and explore
              new interactions to build elegant solutions.

              Right now, I‚Äôm focused on wrapping up my degree in communication
              studies, computer science, and design @

              (graduating June 2020). Throughout college, I‚Äôve had the chance to
              see how tech gets built at a variety of different companies,
              too--most recently by shipping products for Groupon Goods @

              I like to work on the end-to-end process of building effective UX
              flows, and I have a tendency to approach life outside of work with
              a similar mindset: it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that I approach
              tasks like Spotify playlist creation and organization with a
              hyper-critical eye. This goes in both directions, so if I refer
              to:
