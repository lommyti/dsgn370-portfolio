            <p>
              I‚Äôm Tommy, a digital product designer. I love to question
              assumptions, find patterns, hone into clear user-centric problems,
              and build elegant solutions.
            </p>

              Usually, I‚Äôm focused on wrapping up my degree in communication
              studies, computer science, and design @

              (graduating June 2020). Throughout college, I‚Äôve had the chance to
              see how tech gets built at a variety of different companies by
              shipping products for Groupon Goods @

              in San Francisco! I'm honing my product design skills and
              improving the Wish merchant experience across mobile and web on

              I like to work on the end-to-end process of building effective UX
              flows, and to ground my work in existing tools / patterns until
              it's time to venture into the unknown. I have a tendency to
              approach life outside of work with a similar mindset: it shouldn‚Äôt
              be surprising that I approach tasks like Spotify playlist creation
              and organizing my life with a meticulous hand and zany vision.
              This goes in both directions, so if I refer to:
